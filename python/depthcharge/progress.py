"""
This module contains functionality pertaining to tracking
and reporting the progress of long running operations.

API users should stick to using Depthcharge.create_progress_indicator()
and Depthcharge.close_progress_indicator(), when possible.

When possible, we seek to lazily import dependencies, such that
those who cannot satisfy the dependencies can simply avoid the
use of that corresponding functionality (e.g. tqdm).

    usage indicates that no progress should be presented. Otherwise, the
    :py:class:`.ProgressBar` subclass can be used to display the progress status
    of an ongoing operation.

        :py:meth:`.Progress.update()` reaches this value.
