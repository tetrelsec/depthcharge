"""
This module provides memory access functionality through :py:class:`.MemoryReader`
and :py:class:`.MemoryWriter` abstractions. These abstractions allow one to write
re-usable scripts and tools to interact with exposed U-Boot consoles, even when
the available commands vary platform to platform.

The underlying implementations are built atop of both U-Boot console commands
specifically intended for arbitrary memory access, as well as those often
overlooked (when deployed in production systems) as memory-access primitives.

During the initialization of a :py:class:`~depthcharge.Depthcharge` context,
the target platform is inspected to determine which memory operations are
available. In general, an API user should not need to manually instantiate
any of the classes within this *depthcharge.memory* subpackage. Instead, one only needs
to interact with higher level methods such as
:py:meth:`Depthcharge.read_memory() <depthcharge.Depthcharge.read_memory>`
and
:py:meth:`Depthcharge.write_memory() <depthcharge.Depthcharge.write_memory>`.
Familiarity with the underlying implementations, however, allows one to
choose an specific implementation (via the *impl=* keyword argument)
or introduce new implementations atop of vendor-specific commands.
