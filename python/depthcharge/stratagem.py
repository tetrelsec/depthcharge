class Stratagem:
    """
    Some :py:class:`~depthcharge.Operation` implementations, such as
    :py:class:`~depthcharge.memory.CRC32MemoryWriter`, cannot perform their objective directly (e.g.
    writing an arbitrary value to a selected memory address). Instead, they must perform a
    roundabout sequence of operation to achieve this goal.

    Within the Depthcharge project, this type of indirect operation is referred to as a
    `Stratagem <https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/stratagem>`_.

    A Stratagem encapsulates a list of dictionaries, whose keys are defined and only relevant to the
    corresponding :py:class:`~depthcharge.hunter.Hunter` and :py:class:`~depthcharge.Operation`
    implementations that generate and use them, respectively.

    :py:class:`~depthcharge.Operation` subclasses that require a Stratagem are expected to provide
    a "*Stratagem specification*" via their :
    :py:meth:`Operation.stratagem_spec() <depthcharge.Operation.stratagem_spec>` method.

    API users usually do not need to instantiate a Stratagem directly, but rather receive them
    from :py:meth:`Hunter.build_stratagem() <depthcharge.hunter.Hunter.build_stratagem>`
    implementations. Nonetheless, the constructor arguments are as follows:

    * The *op_class* argument shall be an :py:class:`~depthcharge.Operation` subclass (not an
      instance of that class, but the class itself) that provides a Stratagem specification
      in its :py:meth:`stratagem_spec() <depthcharge.Operation.stratagem_spec>` method.
    * If the final size of the Stratagem is known in advance, it can be created with this initial
      capacity via the **capacity** keyword. Doing this allows the Stratagem entries to be
      set using the index (``[]``) notation implemented by ``__setitem__``. Otherwise,
      :py:meth:`append()` must be used to add entries to the Stratagem.
